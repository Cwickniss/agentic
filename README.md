## "The Price Is Right" Deal Hunting Agent

Welcome to the code to accompany the Agent workshop.

### A note before you begin

I'm here to help you be most successful with your learning! If you hit any snafus, or if you have any ideas on how I can improve the course, please do reach out in the platform or by emailing me direct (ed@edwarddonner.com). It's always great to connect with people on LinkedIn to build up the community - you'll find me here:

## Setup instructions

Hopefully I've done a decent job of making these guides bulletproof - but please contact me right away if you hit roadblocks:

- PC people please follow the instructions in [SETUP-PC.md](SETUP-PC.md)
- Mac people please follow the instructions in [SETUP-mac.md](SETUP-mac.md)
- Linux people, the Mac instructions should be close enough!

### An important point on API costs (which are optional! No need to spend if you don't wish)

During this example project, I'll suggest you try out the leading models at the forefront of progress, known as the Frontier models. These services have some charges, but I'll keep cost minimal - like, a few cents at a time. And I'll provide alternatives if you'd prefer not to use them.

Please do monitor your API usage to ensure you're comfortable with spend; I've included links below. There's no need to spend anything more than a couple of dollars for the entire course. Some AI providers such as OpenAI require a minimum credit like \$5 or local equivalent; we should only spend a fraction of it, and you'll have plenty of opportunity to put it to good use in your own projects. But it's not necessary in the least; the important part is that you focus on learning.

### The most important part

The best way to learn is by **DOING**. I don't type all the code during the workshop; I execute it for you to see the results. You should work through afterwards, running each cell, inspecting the objects to get a detailed understanding of what's happening. Then tweak the code and make it your own.

### Monitoring API charges

You can keep your API spend very low throughout this course; you can monitor spend at the dashboards: [here](https://platform.openai.com/usage) for OpenAI, [here](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/cost) for Anthropic and [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/generativelanguage.googleapis.com/cost) for Google Gemini.

The charges for the exercsies in this course should always be quite low, but if you'd prefer to keep them minimal, then be sure to always choose the cheapest versions of models:
1. For OpenAI: Always use model `gpt-4o-mini` in the code instead of `gpt-4o`
2. For Anthropic: Always use model `claude-3-haiku-20240307` in the code instead of the other Claude models
3. During week 7, look out for my instructions for using the cheaper dataset

Please do message me or email me at ed@edwarddonner.com if this doesn't work or if I can help with anything. I can't wait to hear how you get on.
